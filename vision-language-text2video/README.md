# Vision–Language Text-to-Video Research Suite  
**Programming Ocean Academy — Deep Learning Division**

---

##  Overview

This repository serves as a **comprehensive research and educational hub** for exploring the evolution of **vision–language models** and their extension into **text-to-video generation**.  
It integrates theoretical reviews, mathematical insights, architectural visualizations, and full **PyTorch educational implementations** of cutting-edge research papers — from **object detection and grounding** to **diffusion-based generative modeling**.

Each notebook or PDF represents a **complete academic workflow**:
1. Paper summarization (Abstract → Problems → Solutions → Methodology → Results → Conclusions)  
2. Mathematical extraction and explanation  
3. ASCII-based architecture diagramming  
4. Simplified PyTorch replication (training, evaluation, visualization)

##  Key Features

- **End-to-End Replications**: From paper to PyTorch to visualization  
- **Mathematical Dissection**: Each notebook extracts and explains formal equations  
- **ASCII Architecture Diagrams**: Lightweight, readable network visualizations  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Quantitative analysis (loss curves, temporal consistency, motion energy)  
- **Educational Visualization**: Frame-by-frame diffusion progression for clarity
