#  Transformers: From *Attention Is All You Need* to Foundation Models (2017–2025)

Welcome to the **Transformer Replication Labs** of the **Programming Ocean Academy**  
This repository is a **pedagogical and experimental collection** tracing the evolution of Transformer-based models — from the 2017 breakthrough paper to today’s multimodal foundation giants.

---

##  What This Repo Offers

-  **Faithful replications** of major Transformer papers  
-  **Clean PyTorch implementations** designed for education and experimentation  
-  **Training, evaluation, and visualization** pipelines  
-  **Historical perspective** on how attention reshaped AI — in NLP, CV, and multimodal learning

---

##  Background: Why Transformers Changed Everything

Before 2017, sequence modeling relied heavily on **RNNs** (LSTM, GRU) and **CNNs** (ConvS2S). These architectures struggled with:

- Long-range dependencies  
- Lack of parallelism  
- Memory and computation limits  

Then came the game-changer:

###  *Attention Is All You Need* (Vaswani et al., 2017)

- Replaced recurrence/convolutions with **multi-head self-attention**  
- Introduced **positional encoding** and **layer normalization**  
- Enabled **massive parallelism** in training  
- Sparked models like **BERT, GPT, ViT, T5, and LLaMA**

##  Methodology

Each notebook follows a **pedagogical development cycle**:

###  Mathematical Foundations

- **Self-Attention**  
  \[
  \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
  \]

- **Multi-Head Attention**  
- **Position-wise Feedforward Networks**  
- **Layer Normalization**  
- **Positional Encoding**

---

###  Implementation

- PyTorch-first, clean, modular code  
- Core components: `MultiHeadAttention`, `EncoderBlock`, `TransformerEncoder`  
- Reproducible training loops with flexible configs

---

###  Evaluation

- **BLEU** — Translation performance  
- **Accuracy** — Classification models  
- **Perplexity** — Language modeling  

---

###  Visualization

- Attention heatmaps  
- Token-level saliency maps  
- PCA / t-SNE of hidden states

##  Results Snapshot

-  Transformer (2017) achieves **SOTA BLEU** on WMT’14 En–De & En–Fr  
-  GPT-3 enables **few-shot and in-context learning**  
-  BERT pretraining creates **universal NLP representations**  
-  ViT competes with or exceeds **ResNet** on ImageNet

##  Mission

This repository is both a **research chronicle** and an **educational playground**.

We aim to:

-  Demystify attention mechanisms and Transformer architecture  
-  Provide clear, first-principles implementations  
-  Empower learners and researchers to build on these foundations
