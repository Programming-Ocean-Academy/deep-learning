#  Old Neural Networks: Foundations to Markov-Inspired Models (1943–2014)

This repository is a curated collection of **educational PyTorch implementations** of foundational neural network and probabilistic models, tracing their historical evolution from the **McCulloch–Pitts Neuron (1943)** to **GRUs (2014)**.  

Each notebook combines:
- Clear theoretical explanation
- Concise mathematical formulations
- Historical context and relevance
- PyTorch implementations
- Training and generalization experiments
- Comparative visualizations

##  Experiments

We provide **training loss curves**, **generalization tests**, and **MSE-based comparisons** across datasets such as:
- **Sine wave (train)**
- **Cosine wave (out-of-distribution)**
- **Shifted sine wave**

### Example: Generalization Comparison (Lower MSE = Better)

| Model                  | Sine (Train) | Cosine (OOD) | Shifted Sine |
|-------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Jordan Net (1986)      | 0.006090     | 0.006092     | 0.006092     |
| Elman Net (1989)       | 0.001806     | 0.001803     | 0.001803     |
| Vanilla RNN (1990s)    | 0.001944     | 0.001944     | 0.001944     |
| LSTM (1997)            | 0.000597     | 0.000596     | 0.000596     |
| GRU (2014)             | 0.000537     | 0.000536     | 0.000536     |

 Results show steady improvement in **generalization and training efficiency** across decades of sequence modeling research.
