#  Speech Recognition Repository  
*Programming Ocean Academy – Deep Learning Track*

---

##  Overview
This repository is a **comprehensive academic and practical resource** for **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**.  
It covers the **historical foundations**, **mathematical models**, and **modern deep learning techniques** that power today’s real-world speech systems.

The repo bridges **statistical methods** (HMMs, GMMs) with **neural architectures** (RNNs, LSTMs, Attention, Transformers, Wav2Vec2.0), documenting the evolution of ASR from physics-inspired models to large-scale deep learning.

##  Core Mathematical Foundations
Speech recognition builds on **statistical physics + probability + deep learning**:

1. **Ising Model (1920s)** → binary states, energy functions.  
2. **HMMs (1970s)** → probabilistic sequence modeling.  
3. **RNNs / LSTMs (1990s–2000s)** → sequence learning with long context.  
4. **Attention & Transformers (2017–)** → global context, parallel training.  
5. **Self-Supervised Models (2020–)** → Wav2Vec2.0, Whisper, scaling ASR.  

Key math tools:  
- Markov chains, EM algorithm, Viterbi decoding.  
- Logistic/sigmoid probability functions.  
- Cross-entropy, KL divergence.  
- Backpropagation through time (BPTT).  
- Self-attention and sequence-to-sequence loss functions (CTC, seq2seq).

- **Apple Siri** (Hybrid HMM → Deep Learning).  
- **Amazon Alexa** (RNN-T, Transformers).  
- **Microsoft Cortana / Azure Speech** (Deep CNNs + RNNs).  
- **OpenAI Whisper** (Transformer-based multilingual ASR).
